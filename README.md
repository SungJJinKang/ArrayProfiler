# Array Profiler

This library is experimental library.         

I was impressed by [this video](https://youtu.be/tD4xRNB0M_Q)             
This video show how ubisoft manage memory usage and profile them and analyze it to optimize it.                    
See [how they alnalyze std::vector to optimize it](https://youtu.be/tD4xRNB0M_Q?t=1288).                                         
It's really interesting that how they optimize use of std::vector.                         

So I decided to make similar thing.          
**This library analyze data containers usage of program and support programers to optimize it.**
